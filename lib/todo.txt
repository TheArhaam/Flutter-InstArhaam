-Implement Followers and Following

-Fix the rerendering of images in the list
-Modify database to generate uniqueID based on date and use it as the main key for the image
-Make sure newest Images show up on top (in Database)
-Show newer images on top in the Mainfeed
-Implement animation for the login screen
-SignIn/SignOut/SignUp
    -Figure out a way to skip signin for already signed in users
    -Add more signup options to make the login page less bland 
-Try to implement Hero() widget for InstArhaam logo on login page to Mainfeed [TRIED|NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED|FURTHER RESEARCH REQUIRED]
-Try to use "Issues" in github instead of creating a temporary ToDo list
-Only owner should have the ability to delete photos
-Images don't immediately get deleted from other users devices [THIS IS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TRACK OF EVERY SINGLE IMAGE, 
IT GETS DELETED WHEN THE PAGE IS REFRESHED AND FOR NOW THATS THE BEST I CAN DO]
-Implement a circular bottomnavigationbar
-Implement some sort of GlobalVariables instead of passing user details between classes
-UserDetails should be stored from google only once, then user should have the ability to change it [HALF COMPLETE | EDIT NEEDS TO BE ADDED]
-**UserDetails should have a listener on it in profilepage so it can be updated whenever values are changed 
    -[POPUP CAUSING PROBLEMS, LISTENER NOT ACTIVE]
    -Update details whenever profilepage is called
    -NOT WORKING BECAUSE USERDETAILS CARD IS IN ANOTHER CLASS FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND IT    
        -MAYBE MAKE IT INTO A FUNCTION INSTEAD OF ANOTHER StatefulWidget
-Improve the way dp loads
-add loading animation to images in profilepage
-Replace upload spinner with a CircularProgressIndicator
-Add a CircularProgressIndicator for the delete button

IMP:
    -onChilChanged: This only returns the newly changed data, not the entire Key:Value pair
        -Best way to solve this problem is to call once().then() on the database and get the entire Key:Value pair
        -Fix dbremove using this


BIG UPGRADES:
-Write firebase functions for updating number of posts, followers and Following
-Updgrade the entire database   
    -Store Users separately with a unique uniqueID
    -Store images separately using that uniqueID
    -Add followers & following to each User (It should contain Unique IDs)
    

WORKS BUT COULD WORK BETTER:
-Fix ImageFade, Placeholder remains in the background
    -If no fix available, set a constraint on the size/the ration of the image (SQUARE/PORTRAIT ONLY ALLOWED)
    -Or just replace it with FadeInImage and figure out another way for getting loadingBuilder details
    [Above two can only be solved if FadeInImage comes with loadingBuilder]
    -Implemented ConstrainedBox for the image, fix it  
        -Image switching isn't smooth figure out something [THE ONLY PROBLEM]
        -Save the image height to the databse and use it to fix the size of the boxes [DONE]

COMPLETE:
-Manage the files to have appropriate classes and functions in their respective files
-Create a new Page for uploading an image, replace the "Upload Image" button
-Appbar title is not in the center, UsersList is pushing it to the right, fix it
